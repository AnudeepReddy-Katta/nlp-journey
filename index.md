## Welcome to Anudeep's NLP Journey 

Watch out this space for neural network based NLP journey in Pytorch

## 1. [Preparing the dataset](https://github.com/AnudeepReddy-Katta/nlp-journey/blob/main/DataPreparation/Preparing_the_data.ipynb)
- Learn how to use torchtext and prepare the dataset. I have used IMDB dataset here for demo.

## 2. [RNN](https://github.com/AnudeepReddy-Katta/nlp-journey/blob/main/RNN/RNN.ipynb)
- RNNs are dead, but it is good to know how Neural Networks have evolved. Here I have tried to build a simple RNN which predicts sentiment of movie review. The network used here is very simple and is giving an accuracy around 50% (which is only as good as random prediction).
